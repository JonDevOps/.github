## Become a Sponsor to w3Develops

In 2017, a student started an open source community called w3Develops.org. This community has grown to include millions of developers from around the world. Together, we have built:

💻 Free study groups and group projects based on freeCodeCamps programming curriculum.

🏛️ Forums and chat rooms where you can get coding help and feedback on your projects.

🧪 The curriculum includes 8,000+ coding tutorials.

🎒 1,000+ free YouTube courses on Computer Science, Data Science, and Machine Learning.

We are fully donor-supported. And we are extremely capital-efficient.

Last year our budget was only about $4,000. And yet we served more than 1 million minutes of learning.

Each dollar you give to w3Develops.org translates into many hours worth of learning for people around the world.
